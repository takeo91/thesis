# Experiment Log Analysis

## Current Experiment Files Analysis

### üü¢ **SUCCESSFUL/IMPORTANT EXPERIMENTS**

1. **experiment_expanded_metrics.log** (31,300 bytes)
   - Status: ‚úÖ **COMPLETED** - Basic 5-metric unified windowing

## Recommended Actions

### Immediate (High Priority)
1. Move successful results to organized structure
2. Archive development experiments  
3. Delete failed experiments
4. Document current experiment status

### Next Phase
1. Wait for expanded experiment to complete
2. Create comprehensive analysis report
3. Generate thesis-ready visualizations
4. Plan final experiment runs if needed
