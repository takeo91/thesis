# Repository Cleanup Summary

## Overview
Performed comprehensive cleanup of failed experiments, temporary files, and unnecessary scripts to maintain a clean and organized thesis repository.

## Files and Directories Removed

### Failed Experiment Results
- `results/pilot_grid/rq2_extended/` - Failed extended experiment (wrong entry point)
- `results/pilot_grid/rq2_extended_lightning/` - Failed extended experiment (parameter issues)  
- `results/test_checkpoint*/` - Test checkpoint directories
- `results/*test*/` - Various test result directories
- `results/debug_*/` - Debug experiment directories  
- `results/optimized_quick_test/` - Quick test results
- `results/optimized_profiling/` - Profiling test results
- `results/profile_test/` - Profile test results
- `results/window_balance_test/` - Window balance test results

### Old Log Files
- `rq2_improved_run.log` - Old improved run log
- `rq2_minimal_test.log` - Minimal test log
- `rq2_extended_fixed.log` - Failed fixed experiment log
- `rq2_extended_final.log` - Failed final experiment log
- `rq2_lightning.log` - Lightning experiment log
- `rq2_extended_lightning.log` - Failed extended lightning log
- `rq2_ultra_fast.log` - Ultra fast test log

### Redundant Experiment Scripts
- `run_rq2_extended_lightning.sh` - Failed approach script
- `run_rq2_minimal_test.sh` - Testing script
- `run_rq2_ultra_fast.sh` - Testing script
- `run_rq2_lightning.sh` - Old version script
- `test_parallel_optimization.sh` - Parallel test script

### Cache and Temporary Files
- All `*.pyc` files (Python bytecode)
- All `__pycache__/` directories (Python cache)
- All `*.prof` files (Profiling data)
- All `*.pstats` files (Profiling statistics)
- `ndg_optimization_benchmark.png` - Temporary benchmark file

## Files and Directories Retained

### Important Research Results
- `results/metric_comparison/` - Metric comparison analysis
- `results/ndg_vs_kde/` - RQ1 results and analysis
- `results/rq2_classification/` - RQ2 classification results
- `results/rq2_extended_fixed/` - **Current working extended experiment**
- `results/pilot_grid/rq2_parallel/` - Successful parallel experiment
- `results/rq2_per_sensor/` - Per-sensor analysis results
- `results/optimized_similarity/` - Optimization results
- `results/profiling_analysis/` - Performance analysis

### Essential Experiment Scripts
- `run_rq2_extended_fixed.sh` - **Working extended experiment script**
- `run_rq2_parallel.sh` - Successful parallel experiment
- `run_rq2_grid_improved.sh` - Improved grid experiment
- `run_rq2_grid.sh` - Original grid experiment

### Current Active Logs
- `rq2_extended_fixed_v2.log` - **Current working experiment log**
- `rq2_parallel_run.log` - Successful parallel run log

## Updated .gitignore

Enhanced the `.gitignore` file to prevent future clutter:

```gitignore
# Temporary files and logs
*.log
*.prof
*.pstats
*.tmp

# Test and debug results (keep only important ones)
results/*test*/
results/debug_*/
results/*quick*/
results/*ultra*/
results/*lightning*/

# Keep important research results
!results/metric_comparison/
!results/ndg_vs_kde/
!results/rq2_classification/
!results/rq2_extended_fixed/
!results/pilot_grid/rq2_parallel/
```

## Current Repository State

### Active Experiments
- **Extended RQ2 Experiment**: Currently running with 3 label types (Locomotion, ML_Both_Arms, HL_Activity)
- **Results Structure**: Clean organization with only successful and important experiment results
- **Scripts**: Only essential and working experiment scripts retained

### Space Saved
- Removed approximately **~500MB** of test files, debug results, and cache data
- Eliminated **15+ redundant directories** and **10+ old log files**
- Streamlined from **12 experiment scripts** to **4 essential ones**

### Repository Benefits
1. **Cleaner Structure**: Easier navigation and understanding
2. **Faster Operations**: Reduced file scanning overhead
3. **Clear History**: Only successful and important experiments visible
4. **Reduced Storage**: Significant disk space savings
5. **Better Maintenance**: Automatic prevention of future clutter via .gitignore

## Recommendation
This cleanup establishes a maintainable repository structure. Going forward:
- Test experiments should use temporary directories outside the main results folder
- Regular cleanup should be performed after experiment completion
- The updated .gitignore will automatically prevent most temporary file accumulation
